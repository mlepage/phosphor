<p>Looking for the <a href='../phosphor-old/'>old version</a>?</p>

<p>The old version has graphics and nice editors, but is effectively a prototype.</p>

<p>This new version has much stronger foundations, but it's still catching up in features, so please have patience and check back regularly.</p>

<p>Notable new features: 240x160 res, 64 colours, 60 fps, new font, and file system APIs.</p>

<p>Coming soon: more I/O improvements, and editor enhancements. Eventually: graphics, input, etc.</p>
